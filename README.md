## Overview
    Project:       GWLP:R
    Info:          It's a set of game-apps for Reality:Shard that emulates a GW (1) server.
    Languages:     Java
    People:        _rusty, ACB, miracle444

**Current work**

This project is very slow in development, so dont expect a fully working game server in the near future.
As for the current development, we are basically designing the software like a sandbox, that can be extended by
other developers. If you want to contribute to this project, you can either join the development team, or add
pull requests, according to this guide: [The diaspora git-flow guide](https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/wiki/Git-Workflow)
Yes, this guide was made for the diaspora project, but it covers the basics quite well.
