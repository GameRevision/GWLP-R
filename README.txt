Languages:   Java, Lua(?), C/C++, AutoIt
People:      see contributer's list (should be out there somewhere)



Current work:
-------------
There is no server code here, as we are not working on it yet.

To those who think this is odd:
The main reason for GWLP:R taking such a long time for development is
because we decided to rework the whole code serveral times, not because 
we had any problems with GW. Reworks are necessary when the code gets a mess
and you are facing problems that you didn't come up with from the start.
So let's hope this is the last and final from-scratch rework.

In the meantime, if you'r one of those leechers out there:
Take your time to register with GR and discuss anything project related there.
